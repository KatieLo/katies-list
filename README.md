# katies_list
Katie's list is a simple one-page React.js app to find day cares.
My goal in building this was primarly as a way to learn React. I plan to keep improving and adding more data to this project in the hopes that one day it can also make life a tiny but easier for parents and caregivers overwhelmed by the task of finding a suitable day care by allowing them to see what's in the area, and filter by the criteria they care about.
